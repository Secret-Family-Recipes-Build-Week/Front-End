      "description": "The secret of my mom's grasshopper pie is that she doubles the regular recipe, making it big enough to make it in a springform pan instead of a regular pie plate. The result is a giant, minty, Oreo-y monster that she always makes at Christmas. This will usually make some extra; you can make a second small pie on the side after the big springform. â€”Katie Notopoulos",
